COURSE TITLE: Applied Java Programming  
COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
This is the third course in the Java sequence and will extend a student’s Java knowledge to  
include web applications. Many of today’s popular Java web frameworks are built on top of the  
Servlet and Jakarta Server Page specifications and base libraries. To fully understand how these  
frameworks, operate, and to be able to take full advantage of the facilities they offer, students  
will learn the foundations that these frameworks are built on. This course will explore how it is  
possible to build a web application using these fundamental technologies, as well as learning  
techniques to manipulate databases using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), and the creation  
of web components utilizing the latest Java web frameworks (examples may include Spring,  
Struts, Java Server Faces, GWT, etc.). Students will demonstrate deploying web-based  
frameworks that are secure and stable and fully support API and web services.
