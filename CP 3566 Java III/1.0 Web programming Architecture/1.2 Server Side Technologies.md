# Server Side Technologies
## Java

- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language).
- It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning you can write a Java program once and run it anywhere (using the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM). 
- Java is commonly used for building web applications, mobile apps (Android), enterprise-level applications, and more.

>[!info] Java is known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability, meaning compiled Java code can run on any system that has the Java runtime environment (JRE).

Example of Java code:

>[!example]
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## 2. Java Persistence API (JPA)

JPA is a Java specification for managing, storing, and retrieving data from relational databases. It provides an abstraction layer for database interactions, allowing developers to use Java objects (entities) to represent database tables. JPA is part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform but can also be used with other Java frameworks.

JPA simplifies database operations by providing an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, which eliminates the need for direct SQL queries for many common operations. It also provides features like entity relationships, caching, and transaction management.

Some common implementations of JPA are **Hibernate**, **EclipseLink**, and **OpenJPA**.

Example of JPA code:

```java
@Entity
public class Customer {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    
    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example, the `Customer` class is an entity that represents a table in a database.

## Java Application Servers

Java Application Servers are software platforms that provide an environment for running Java-based applications, particularly Java EE (Enterprise Edition) applications. They handle the deployment, execution, and management of web applications, enterprise applications, and services.

Java application servers typically provide support for Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), JPA, messaging services, and other enterprise-level features.

Some popular Java application servers include:

- **Apache Tomcat**: A lightweight servlet container and web server.
- **WildFly (formerly JBoss)**: A full-featured Java EE application server.
- **GlassFish**: An open-source Java EE application server.
- **WebLogic Server**: A commercial Java EE application server from Oracle.

Java application servers typically offer features like:

- **Servlet Container**: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **EJB Container**: For managing Enterprise JavaBeans, which are server-side components used in enterprise applications.
- **Transaction Management**: To handle distributed transactions in enterprise systems.
- **Security**: To manage authentication, authorization, and secure communication.

Example of deploying a Java EE application:

- In a **Tomcat** server, you can deploy a `.war` file (Web Application Archive) that contains your web application.
- In **WildFly** or **GlassFish**, you would typically deploy an enterprise `.ear` file (Enterprise Archive) that includes multiple modules.

### Summary:

- **Java**: A versatile programming language used for a wide range of applications.
- **JPA**: A specification that helps Java developers interact with databases using object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **Java Application Servers**: Platforms that manage and run Java applications, providing services such as servlet handling, transaction management, and security.

These technologies are commonly used together to build scalable, maintainable, and efficient enterprise-level applications.
