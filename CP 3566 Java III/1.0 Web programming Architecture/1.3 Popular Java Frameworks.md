## Spring

The Spring Framework is an open-source application framework and Inversion of Control (IoC) container for Java. Its core features can be used in any Java application, while extensions are available for building web applications on top of Java EE (Enterprise Edition). Spring does not enforce a specific programming model and has gained popularity in the Java community as an alternative to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model.
