## HTML

HTML is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It consists of elements, or tags, that define the structure of web pages, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage.


```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> 
<head>     
<meta charset="UTF-8">     
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">     <title>My Webpage</title> 
</head> 
<body>     
<h1>Hello World</h1>     
<p>Welcome to my website!</p> </body> </html>
```

## CSS

CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of a web page. It controls the appearance of HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS helps make a website look visually appealing.

```css
body { 
font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 
background-color: #f4f4f4; 
} 
h1 { 
color: blue; 
} 
p { 
color: green; 
}
```

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive behavior on web pages. It allows developers to create dynamic content, handle events (such as clicks or keyboard input), manipulate HTML and CSS, and interact with external APIs. JavaScript is executed in the browser, making webpages interactive without needing to reload the page.

```JavaScript
document.getElementById("myButton").onclick = function() { alert("Hello, world!"); }
```

## HTTP

HTTP is the protocol used for transferring data over the web. When you visit a website, your browser uses HTTP to request and receive resources (such as HTML files, images, and videos) from a web server. HTTP defines the structure of requests and responses between clients (browsers) and servers.
```vb
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 
Host: www.example.com
```
