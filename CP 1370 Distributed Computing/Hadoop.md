## 5 V's of big data

1. **Volume:** Data is being produced in large volumes.
2. **Velocity:** Huge amounts of data is generated per second.
> [!info] It is estimated that by the end of 2020, every individual will produce 3mb data per second. 
4. **Variety:** The data being produced by different means is of three types: 
    - **Structured Data:** It is the relational data which is stored in the form of rows and columns.
    - **Unstructured Data:** Texts, pictures, videos etc. are the examples of unstructured data which can’t be stored in the form of rows and columns.
    - **Semi Structured Data:** Log files are the examples of this type of data.
5. **Veracity:** Inconsistent or incomplete data which results in the generation of doubtful or uncertain Information.
6. **Value:**  Data in itself is of no use or importance but it needs to be converted into something valuable to extract Information.
