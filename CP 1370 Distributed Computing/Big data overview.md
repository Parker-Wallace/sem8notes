# Introduction
> due to the explosion of the internet, enterprise data usage far exceeds what is capable of traditional relational databases. as well, most data is not structured enough to even be relational. thus was the beginning of **Big Data*

## 5 V's of big data

1. **Volume:** Data is being produced in large volumes.
2. **Velocity:** Huge amounts of data is generated per second.
> [!info] It is estimated that by the end of 2020, every individual will produce 3mb data per second. 
4. **Variety:** The data being produced by different means is of three types: 
    - **Structured Data:** It is the relational data which is stored in the form of rows and columns.
    - **Unstructured Data:** Texts, pictures, videos etc. are the examples of unstructured data which can’t be stored in the form of rows and columns.
    - **Semi Structured Data:** Log files are the examples of this type of data.
5. **Veracity:** Inconsistent or incomplete data which results in the generation of doubtful or uncertain Information.
6. **Value:**  Data in itself is of no use or importance but it needs to be converted into something valuable to extract Information.

Apache spark!. which is similarly modeled after dataframe usage of pythons pandas

Hadoop distributed file ssytem (HDFS)! where big data is stored.  
most of these tools have now been replaced by the spark ecossystem due to its ease of use and speed capabilities (up to 1000x faster
