COURSE NUMBER: CP3010  
COURSE TITLE: Server-Side Programming  
COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
The course is designed to build upon existing JavaScript skills and to provide a comprehensive  
overview of web application development using Node.js by focusing on the core competencies  
required to develop Node.js applications for the enterprise. Students will learn the fundamentals  
of server-side web development using MongoDB (a NoSQL database), Express.js (for building  
web servers), and Node.js. These tools and concepts will introduce students to models of  
software development that can apply to any web development environment, including the  
application server (node.js), Model View Controller (MVC) frameworks using Express.js, front-  
end frameworks (e.g. Angular), and databases (MongoDB). The course includes setting up a  
node.js environment, building web APIs and full-stack JavaScript applications, and following  
good application development practices.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES:  
1. Node.js Introduction and Environment Setup  
	1. Describe what Node.js is and how Node.js applications work  
	2. Install a Node.js local environment (Windows or Mac OS)  
	3. Use Node Package Manager (NPM) to manage different versions of Node  
	4. Execute a Node.js script and use the read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) to test arbitrary JavaScript  
	5. Set up an Integrated Development Environment. (e.g. Webstorm, Visual Studio)  
2. Understanding Node.js – JavaScript Revisited  
	1. Revisit key features of JavaScript to help understand how Node.js works, including, but not limited to:  
		1. Create examples that manipulate the values of the main JavaScript types, including: number, string, boolean, and object (e.g. functions, arrays, etc.)  
		2. Create examples of JavaScript functions, including an immediately executing function, anonymous function, and higher-order functions  
		3. Demonstrate the use of JavaScript control structures including conditional statements and looping  
		4. Create examples exploring JavaScript default values, null values, equality, and the ‘this’ keyword  
		5. Demonstrate examples of error handling  
3. Core Features of Node.js  
	1. Describe NPM and the Node.js file-based module system  
	2. Install packages using NPM  
	3. Demonstrate the use of popular Node.js packages such as underscore, optimist, or moment  
	4. Learn how to use Common.js module syntax such as ‘module.exports’ and ‘require’ to manage different JS files in a Node app 
	5. Compare and contrast how node finds built-in modules vs. custom modules  
	6. Import and use core modules like fs, path, and process  
4. Node.js HTTP and Express  
	1. Describe the basics of Node.js HTTP, including the core networking modules net,  dgram, http, and https  
	2. Create a web server to serve base HTML  
	3. Describe the process to make communication secure and demonstrate how to create an HTTPS server  
	4. Install the Express web application framework  
	5. Use Express to complete the following:  
		1. Serve static pages
		2. List directory contents.  
		3. Accept JSON requests and HTML form inputs  
		4. Handle cookies  
		5. Use compression  
		6. Time-out hanging requests  
	6. Create applications that use the Express response and request object  
5. Persisting Data  
	1. Describe the terms ‘data persistence’ and ‘NoSQL’ as they relate to Node.js applications  
	2. Describe the issues of scalability with traditional relational databases  
	3. Install, configure, and demonstrate knowledge of MongoDB, including:  
		1. The MongoDB id field  
		2. The MongoDB Document Format  
	4. Install, configure, and demonstrate the use of an Object Document Mapper (ODM), such as Mongoose, to define objects with a schema that is mapped to a MongoDB document  
	5. Write a Node.js application that uses MongoDB to update a document  
	6. Converting documents into objects using Mongoose  
	7. Use a Mongo database in application, including: querying, schemas, validation, plugins and middleware  
6. Front-End Basics
	1. Write an application that utilizes AngularJS, including the demonstration of the following: 
		1. Use of modules  
		2. Use of directives  
		3. Use of Controllers  
		4. Integration of front-end application to a REST API  
7. Simplifying Callbacks  
	1. Use JavaScript “promises” to simplify the asynchronous calls and error handling  
	2. Integrate and demonstrate the use of JavaScript functions that can be used to control the iterator (e.g. “generators”)  
8. Debugging and Testing  
	1. Use the console object to provide simple logging and analysis  
	2. Use the Node.js debugger and Node-inspector to strategically troubleshoot code  
	3. Write code that utilizes the assert module and/or the Chai library to provide simple logic checks based on invalid situations  
	4. Install and utilize a JavaScript test framework with Node.js (e.g. Mocha)
9. Deployment and Scalability  
	1. Write code that focuses on ensuring uptime of application  
	2. Use Node.js to scale applications to utilize additional CPU cores through clustering  
	3. Demonstrate a knowledge of cloud-based hosting solutions and how to deploy Node.js applications in such environments (e.g. Amazon Web Services)
