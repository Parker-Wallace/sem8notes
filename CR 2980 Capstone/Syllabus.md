COURSE TITLE: Capstone Project  
COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
The capstone project course enables students to demonstrate the application of knowledge and  
skills developed throughout their program of studies. Students taking this course will work in  
teams on a project, under the supervision of a faculty supervisor, and will perform the following:  
1) an in-depth analysis of a problem that requires a software solution developed
2) a design and implementation of the problem solution and 
3) full documentation and presentation of their solution. 
This project can be one from industry or one assigned by the College. If it is an  
industry driven project, prior faculty approval must be provided to ensure it meets the scope,  
depth and focus required to meet the course outcomes.
